# Show Git and GitHub for collaborative writing.

## Contribution

Szene: We work on a preregistration to replicate the stevens power curve for comparing size.

Szene: Your supervisor did something, you review it.

## Intro

* why collaborate on github [aaronpeikert.github.io/presentation](https://aaronpeikert.github.io/repro-collab/presentation)
* ask U to create or login to GitHub (milestone I)
* Explain the learning goals
* Explain the background


## Milestone II Fork

* I and U live
* navigate to the repo
* click on fork
* Explain Fork
* show and explain the tracking issue, explain the milestone list, explain relaod of tracking issue.
* activate issues in fork
* show /done 3 

## Milestone III

* U: Activate issues in your fork. ☑️
* C: Create issue telling user to create issue "preregistrations needed". ☑️

## Milestone IV

* U: create "preregistrations needed" issue. ☑️
* C: Check that there is an issue called "preregistrations needed", if not, respond with "We need that, for real". ☑️

## Milestone V

* U: close issue "Create your own first issue" ☑️
* C: react to issue called "preregistrations needed" by creating PR that proposes the changes.

## Milestone VI

* C: GIF how to suggest changes. ☑️
* C: Check that they made a suggestion. ☑️

## Milestone VII

* U: Merges the pull request (perhaps with applied changes). ☑️
* C: check that they have the file preregistration.md in their main.

## Milestone VIII

* U: Find partner

## Milestone IX

* U: Decide on a fork to work in (less experienced person)
* U: updload a datafile generated by shiny app from both U
* U: may decide on upload mechanism and permission mechanism
* C: check that both users have added files

## Milestone X

* C: create a bunch of issues for the pairs to solve in preregistration.md
* I: reiterate permissions of forking, show them how to use github.dev online editor
* U: devide and solve the issues without creating a giant mess
* Together, edit the preregistration draft in this fork, making meaningful commits and following the collaborative writing 

# Old Rest

13. I: Explain: Teams of two, working one after the other. Use the “weaker” person’s fork.
14. U: Form a pair and decide whose fork to use (choose the person less familiar with GitHub).
15. U: Together, edit the preregistration draft in this fork, making meaningful commits and following the collaborative writing cheat sheet. Open a pull request for each substantial change, and review and discuss suggestions.
16. U: Resolve any conflicts and open discussions before merging. Repeat the process for further changes, always working sequentially in the same fork.
17. U: git checkout upstream
18. U: git branch -B data
19. U: start with "Study", everyone is doing the Steven experiment in there own fork, own branch.
20. U: git commit/ git push
21. U: create PR
22. C: merging only data folder fork into data branch aaronpeikert/repro-collab

Idea: two person teams, weaker person forks is used. doing a colobaration **sequential**. Going trough a checklist. Everything in the UI. Everything in main.
For example: each person opens an issue and works on the issue of the other (sequential, so make clear that one is reviewer and one is editor first, and then change roles)?

xx. Commit, push data to their fork, open PR, pr merged automatically.


## Collab

Szene: Users have added data and have changed prereg in unpredictiable ways.
Goal: Users add data to upstream, merge all data into their fork:

1. U: 

# Questions
- Can we have a PDF rendering in the forked repo?

# Not shown so far

- assigning people to issues


# Collaborative Writing Cheat Sheet

## Writing

- Write one sentence per line.
- Every sentence ends with a period, colon, semicolon.
- Keep paragraphs focused on a single idea.
- Use clear and concise language.
- Use consistent terminology and tense throughout the document.

## Commits & Changes

- Summarize your changes in meaningful commit messages.
- Do not delete large sections without prior discussion.
- When opening a pull request, describe what you changed and why.

## Collaboration & Review

- Review your partner’s changes constructively and suggest improvements.
- Discuss any uncertainties or disagreements in pull request comments.
- Ask for feedback if you are unsure about your changes.
- Resolve all open discussions before merging.
