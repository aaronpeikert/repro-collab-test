            Thank you for forking the repository and getting started with the workshop! 
            *Forking* means that you created a copy of the original workshop repository, whereas a *repository* is the central project folder in GitHub. 
            
            The **Cheat Sheet** in the repository gives a quick overview of the key terms on GitHub and their core functions.
            
            Currently, you are in an *issue*, which is a way to track tasks, ideas, or bugs within a specific repository.

            If you have a problem, a suggestion for improvement, or cool ideas during the workshop, please open an issue: https://github.com/${context.repo.owner}/${context.repo.repo}/issues/new

            Throughout the workshop, we use this issue to track your progress. 
            Every time you comment with \`/done NUMBER\`, the list below gets updated.

            **Note**: Please complete the tasks in your forked repository, but always return to this issue in the original workshop repository to indicate that you‚Äôre done. 
            
            *Why?* This is due to the technical setup of the workshop. You‚Äôre working in your fork, but the issue that tracks your progress is in the original repository. 
            Since you don‚Äôt have write access there, you cannot edit the issue directly (for example, by checking checkboxes). We'll provide links along the way that lead to the correct places to make your life easier.

            In any collaboration, some tasks need to be done on your own (e.g., to get some focused work done), which is why you‚Äôll work alone in the first milestones. 
            Of course, you can always ask your partner or us if something is unclear! 
            
            Let‚Äôs approach this like a true scientist: step by step, with curiosity, precision, and a healthy dose of skepticism (and maybe a coffee or two). 
            If you hit an unexpected result, remember‚Äîevery great discovery started with a question. 
            Data, documentation, and reproducibility are our friends here.
            
            **Next step:**  
            Please enable ‚ÄúIssues‚Äù in your forked repository so we can collaborate, track your progress, and (most importantly) keep a clear record of our scientific journey.
            
            To enable issues:
            
            1. Open your repository's **Settings**: https://github.com/${FORK_REPO}/settings  
            2. Scroll down to the **Features** section.  
            3. Check the box labeled **‚ÄúIssues‚Äù**.  
            4. When finished, comment here in this issue with \`/done 3\`.
            
            If something doesn‚Äôt match the documentation or you spot an anomaly, don‚Äôt hesitate to ask or to open an issue: https://github.com/${context.repo.owner}/${context.repo.repo}/issues/new
            In science, there are no silly questions, only hypotheses waiting to be tested. 
            Let‚Äôs keep things reproducible, transparent, and maybe even a bit fun. 
            Happy experimenting!
